![Convespresso Machine](/assets/espresso.jpg)

I modified a Gaggia Classic Pro (espresso machine) with [Logan Bell](https://web.stanford.edu/~lmbell/), and we programmed it with [Alan Yang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1R3tMcYAAAAJ&hl=en). The machine is now outfitted with some internal hardware that allows for somewhat granular temperature and pressure control (and a much sleeker interface). Mathematicians turn coffee into theorems, and in theory, better coffee means better theorems.
